Shannon Yang’s IntelliJ IDEA Live Templates

These are the IntelliJ IDEA Live Templates that I’ve used in many demos and screencasts over the years.

I used IntelliJ’s sharing live templates feature, to create idea-settings.jar. You should be able to import "Matt Raible’s Shortcuts" using the following steps:

On the File menu, click Import Settings.

Specify the path to the JAR file with the exported live template configuration.

In the Import Settings dialog box, select the Live templates check box and click OK.

After restarting IntelliJ IDEA, you will see the imported live templates on the Live Templates page of the Settings / Preferences Dialog.

Download IntelliJ IDEA today! It’s a spectacular IDEA for Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript, S/CSS, and HTML.

If you’d rather not import all of my templates, you can clone this project and open it in IntelliJ (with the Asciidoctor plugin installed). You should be able to edit this file and add the shortcuts below as live templates (Tools > Save as Live Template). Make sure to set the file type to match the language.
